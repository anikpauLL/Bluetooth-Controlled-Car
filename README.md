# Bluetooth-Controlled-Car


A **Bluetooth-controlled Arduino car** designed and implemented as part of **ETE-300** coursework at **Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET)**. This project demonstrates the practical use of **Bluetooth communication**, **Arduino microcontroller programming**, and **DC motor control** to build a remotely operated mobile vehicle.

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a simple, reliable, and educational **remote-controlled car** using Bluetooth technology. A smartphone application communicates wirelessly with an Arduino via an **HC-05 Bluetooth module**, allowing the user to control the car’s movement in real time.

The system does not use sensors, making it a **manual control vehicle** rather than an autonomous robot. It serves as an excellent learning platform for beginners in embedded systems and robotics.
